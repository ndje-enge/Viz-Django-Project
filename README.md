# French Real Estate Analysis Project

Django web application for analyzing and visualizing real estate transaction data in France for the years 2020 and 2022.

## Description

This project is an interactive web application that allows you to visualize and analyze property values of real estate transactions in France. The application offers interactive graphical visualizations including scatter plots and choropleth maps showing average prices by region.

## Features

- **Property Value Visualization**: Scatter plots showing the relationship between property values, transaction months, and property types
- **Temporal Comparison**: Ability to compare data between 2020 and 2022
- **Geographic Maps**: Cartographic visualization of average prices by French region
- **Data Cleaning**: Automatic processing of outliers and enrichment with regional data
- **Interactive Interface**: Dynamic year selection and real-time visualizations

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Django 4.2.1
- **Data Analysis**: 
  - Pandas - data manipulation and analysis
  - NumPy - numerical calculations
- **Visualization**:
  - Plotly Express - interactive charts
  - Folium - interactive geographic maps

## Data Sources

- Real state value datasets from https://data.gouv.fr/
- French regions boundaries dataset from https://france-geojson.gregoiredavid.fr/

## Data Processing

The application performs several cleaning and enrichment operations:

1. **Cleaning unnecessary columns**: Removal of irrelevant columns
2. **Outlier detection**: Using the 7 standard deviations method
3. **Geographic enrichment**: Automatic assignment of regions from department codes
4. **Temporal extraction**: Creation of a "Month" column from mutation dates

## Regions Covered

The application covers all French regions:
- Metropolitan France: 13 regions (Île-de-France, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, etc.)
- Overseas: Guadeloupe, Martinique, Guyana, La Réunion, Mayotte

### Main Settings

The `ProjetP/settings.py` file contains the Django configuration:
- `DEBUG = True`: Development mode (should be disabled in production)
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS = []`: Should be configured for production
- SQLite3 database by default

### URLs

Routes are defined in:
- `ProjetP/urls.py`: Main configuration (admin, polls)
- `polls/urls.py`: Application routes (index, page1, page2, etc.)

## Notes

School project completed in 2022 as an introduction at Django.
